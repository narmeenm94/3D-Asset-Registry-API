1.	Introduction
METRO develops and maintains a generic 3D asset library for DTRIP4H Work Package 9, consisting of reusable scientific visualization components including molecular structure templates, ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) visualization frameworks, cancer cell models, dopamine carrier protein structures, and CAMS (Computer-Aided Molecular Screening) visualization tools. These assets are generic, non-sensitive visualization building blocks that contain no research data, personally identifiable information, or proprietary institutional data.
The asset library architecture is explicitly designed as containerized, infrastructure-agnostic, and deployable across the federated DDTE (Distributed Digital Twin Environment) infrastructure. During the initial development phase (M1-M18), the library is temporarily hosted on METRO infrastructure for development and testing purposes. The primary production deployment target is integration with DDTE federated nodes (M19+), with the architecture supporting distributed deployment across multiple DDTE nodes for high availability and geographic distribution.
These generic 3D assets are generated through specialized client-side Blender plugins that execute entirely on researcher workstations at Research Infrastructure (RI) sites. The plugins process sensitive research data locally (which never leaves RI boundaries), optionally retrieve generic visualization templates from the asset library, and compose final visualizations on the researcher's workstation. This architecture maintains strict data sovereignty while enabling reusable visualization components to be shared across the DTRIP4H ecosystem.
As the DTRIP4H project operates in a federated architecture where multiple institutions host DDTE nodes, there is a critical need for machine-readable, semantic metadata that enables automated discovery of generic visualization assets across decentralized nodes. This document defines an RDF-based metadata framework that enables cross-node asset discovery and interoperability within the federated DDTE ecosystem. The framework ensures that generic visualization assets can be discovered, accessed, and reused by researchers across all partner institutions while maintaining clear provenance and supporting distributed deployment models.
2.	METRO’s Current Architecture
METRO's 3D asset platform implements a comprehensive two-part system addressing automated asset generation, management, and distribution within the DTRIP4H ecosystem.
Server-side Infrastructure
The server-side platform consists of a containerized Middleware RESTful API that acts as the gateway to the generic asset library, handling discovery, retrieval, submission, and curation of reusable visualization components. The architecture is infrastructure-agnostic and designed for deployment across DDTE federated nodes. The underlying system separates concerns between a relational database for metadata storage with indexing capabilities (PostgreSQL-compatible) and S3-compatible object storage for binary asset files supporting multiple formats including glTF 2.0, USDZ, .blend, and .fbx files with comprehensive version management. During development (M1-M18), the platform is temporarily hosted on METRO local infrastructure. Production deployment (M19+) will integrate with DDTE federated infrastructure, supporting multi-node deployment for high availability and geographic distribution.
Client-side Toolset
The client-side system centers on five domain-specific Blender plugins, each tailored for specific scientific visualization needs. All plugins execute entirely on researcher workstations at RI facilities, ensuring that sensitive research data never leaves institutional boundaries. Plugins process local data files, optionally retrieve generic visualization templates from the asset library, and generate visualizations locally:
•	Molecule Visualizer - Processes molecular structure data from local PDB files, optionally retrieves generic molecular templates
•	ADMET Visualizer - Generates pharmacokinetic models from local CSV datasets with optional generic visualization frameworks
•	CAMS Visualizer - Creates air quality visualizations from local NetCDF files
•	Cancer Cell Visualizer - Produces cellular structure models from local research data using optional generic cell templates
•	Dopamine Carrier Visualizer - Specializes in neurotransmitter protein structures from local PDB data
Current Metadata Format
The platform currently utilizes JSON-based metadata with the following core properties: id, name, description, format, triCount, tags, version, uploader, createdAt, updatedAt, provenance, and useCase.
This metadata structure supports tag-based discovery, provenance tracking linking assets to their generation tools and source data references, and version management with immutable history.
Authentication and API Endpoints
Authentication is delegated to the DDTE federated identity system through JWT token validation, ensuring secure access without credential storage at asset library nodes. The RESTful API exposes standard endpoints: /assets for listing and search operations, /assets/{id} for detailed asset information, /assets/{id}/file for binary file downloads, and POST/assets for contributing new generic assets. The API is designed for service discovery integration within DDTE infrastructure, supporting automatic endpoint registration and multi-node deployment.
3.	Technical Framework Recommendation
Recommended Approach: JSON-LD with Hybrid Vocabulary
Based on analysis of METRO's architecture and requirements, this specification recommends adopting JSON-LD as the serialization format combined with a hybrid vocabulary approach utilizing established RDF standards extended with custom METRO-specific properties.
JSON-LD as Serialization Format
JSON-LD provides the optimal path forward by extending METRO's current JSON metadata structure through the addition of semantic context. This approach maintains complete backward compatibility while adding a semantic layer that enables machine-readable interpretation. JSON-LD works seamlessly with the existing RESTful API architecture and provides web-compatible, standards-based metadata that can be consumed by both human users and automated systems.
DCAT as Base Vocabulary
The Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) serves as the foundation vocabulary, providing standardized properties for dataset and resource descriptions. DCAT offers core concepts such as dcat:Dataset , dcat:Distribution, and dcat:keyword that enable cross-platform discovery and integration with other data catalog systems within the DTRIP4H ecosystem.
Schema.org Extensions
Schema.org vocabulary extensions, particularly the 3DModel type and creative work properties, provide broader web integration capabilities and ensure compatibility with general-purpose semantic web tools and search engines.

Custom METRO Vocabulary
A custom METRO vocabulary namespace ( http://dtrip4h.eu/metro/vocab# ) defines 3D-specific technical properties not covered by standard vocabularies, including triangleCount, lodLevels, generationTool, pluginVersion, sourceDataFormat, and useCaseDomain classifications.
This hybrid approach offers minimal disruption to existing systems by extending rather than replacing current JSON structures. It provides standards-based interoperability enabling integration across federated DDTE nodes and external systems while maintaining flexibility to accommodate 3D-specific asset properties. The approach supports the project's federated architecture by enabling cross-node discovery through semantic queries, automatic service discovery, and distributed catalog federation. It ensures compliance with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), supports EOSC integration requirements, and provides comprehensive provenance tracking to clearly distinguish generic visualization components from sensitive research data. The approach is future-proof and extensible as new visualization types emerge and remains fully compatible with the client-side Blender plugin architecture and containerized deployment model.
4.	METRO 3D Asset Metadata Model
Distinction: Generic Assets vs. Research Data
It is critical to understand that the assets described by this RDF framework are generic, reusable visualization components, not sensitive research data. The metadata model explicitly distinguishes between these categories through the metro:dataClassification property. Generic assets in the METRO library include molecular structure templates, cell visualization frameworks, anatomical references, and environmental visualization tools. These assets contain no sensitive information, personally identifiable information (PII), or proprietary research results. Sensitive research data remains exclusively at RI nodes and is processed locally by client-side Blender plugins. The RDF metadata framework enables discovery and reuse of generic visualization building blocks while maintaining strict data sovereignty for actual research data.

5.	Implementation Approach
The implementation of the RDF framework follows a four-phase approach aligned with METRO's deployment timeline and DTRIP4H federated architecture requirements:
Phase 1: Vocabulary Definition:
•	Define the METRO custom vocabulary namespace (e.g. at https://dtrip4h.eu/metro/vocab#) and publish comprehensive documentation including property definitions, expected data types, and usage examples.
•	Create JSON-LD context definitions that combine DCAT, Schema.org, Dublin Core, and METRO vocabularies. Document FAIR compliance mappings and DDTE integration requirements.
•	Publish vocabulary specification for review by WP6/WP7 teams to ensure alignment with DDTE service registry standards.
Phase 2: API Enhancement:
•	Extend the Middleware API to return JSON-LD formatted metadata by adding @context properties to all JSON responses.
•	Implement content negotiation to support both application/json (backward compatibility) and application/ld+json (semantic format) based on client Accept headers.
•	Add federated infrastructure metadata (hosting node, service endpoint, replication status) to all asset descriptions. Implement DDTE service discovery integration and prepare for containerized deployment.
•	Update API documentation with JSON-LD examples and federated deployment scenarios.
Phase 3: Plugin Integration:
•	Update Blender plugins to generate JSON-LD metadata during asset export and upload processes. Implement client-side validation of JSON-LD structure before submission.
•	Ensure plugins populate all required semantic properties including provenance information, domain classifications, and data classification flags (marking assets as "generic-public" to distinguish from sensitive research data).
•	Add support for dynamic service discovery allowing plugins to automatically locate asset library endpoints across DDTE nodes.
Phase 4: DDTE Integration & Federated Deployment (M19-M24):
•	Migrate from development infrastructure to DDTE-integrated production deployment. Publish DCAT-compliant federated catalog endpoints that expose the generic asset collection for discovery across all DDTE nodes.
•	Implement DDTE service registry integration with automatic endpoint registration and health monitoring.
•	Establish cross-node federation protocols enabling researchers at any RI to discover and access generic visualization assets regardless of hosting location.
•	Provide SPARQL query capabilities for advanced semantic searches across the federated catalog.
•	Deploy optional distributed mirrors at high-utilization RI sites to optimize performance and enable local compliance requirements.
•	Implement local authorization enforcement that evaluates metro:accessLevel and related permission properties against DDTE JWT token claims (user ID, institution, roles) as defined in D9.1 Section 8.4.1-8.4.3.

This JSON-LD example provides a complete, production-ready metadata description for a UC2 ADMET visualization asset deployed on federated DDTE infrastructure. The metadata demonstrates comprehensive coverage of all property categories defined in Section 4, including JSON-LD fundamentals, identification, technical specifications, provenance, domain classification, version management, distribution, access control, federated infrastructure integration, standards compliance, and optional descriptive metadata. 
The example clearly distinguishes this generic visualization template from sensitive research data through the metro:dataClassification property and detailed deployment notes. This metadata can be directly integrated into DDTE-federated API responses and supports automated cross-node discovery, service registry integration, and distributed deployment scenarios while maintaining full backward compatibility with the current JSON metadata format.
Permission Management Integration: The example demonstrates the integration of the decentralized permission management model defined in D9.1 Section 8.4.2. The metro:accessLevel property defines the hierarchical permission level (private < group < institution < consortium < approval_required < public), while metro:ownerId and metro:ownerInstitution establish ownership. The metro:authorizedInstitutions array lists all DTRIP4H partner institutions with consortium-level access. Local RI nodes evaluate these properties during authorization checks after DDTE authentication. The JWT token from DDTE provides user identity and institution membership, but final access decisions are made locally by comparing token claims against the asset's permission metadata. This approach preserves RI autonomy while enabling federated discovery across all consortium nodes.

The framework leverages established semantic web standards (DCAT 2.0, Schema.org, Dublin Core) for maximum interoperability while extending them with domain-specific 3D asset properties through the custom METRO vocabulary. This hybrid approach ensures compatibility with general-purpose data catalogs and search engines while providing the specialized metadata required for scientific 3D visualization assets. The JSON-LD serialization format ensures web compatibility, machine readability, and seamless integration with existing JSON-based APIs.
